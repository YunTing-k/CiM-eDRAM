# CiM eDRAM
这是一个基于器件性能出发的仿真器/评估工具，根据器件性能（包括variation，noise）完成从神经网络训练、量化、硬件部署（简单模拟）到阵列性能指标评估。其中存算一体单元主要是eDRAM单元，或电导作为权重存储/计算值的器件都可支持。
This is a computing in memory simulator/evaluator tools. Based on the device's performance/property(including device variation and noise), from CNN training, NN quantization, NN Hardware implementation(rough simulation) and perofrmance evaluation, a complete flow is realized. The basic CiM cell is mainly eDRAM cell or conductance device or other device catagorey that use conductance to store the weight.
